# C-13X-STM32-PCB-Converted-Keyboard
Converted C-13X handwired keyboard to STM32 PCB version.

USB C port would need a small USB C to USB A cable to connect to case hole to outside. I didn't choose a USB C daughterboard design because I don't like daughterboards. This PCB design has not been printed or tested yet. Will print soon. The PCB should fit existing case since I copied the PCB outline from another designer who converted the original C-13X to ATMEGA.
